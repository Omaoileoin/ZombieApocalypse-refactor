Game Parameters


The game area is a top-down background depicting the player’s house.
The player is confined to the game area by ‘if statements’ resetting the player’s position if they try to go outside of the game area. 
To move, use the keys w, s, a, and d to move up, down, left, or right.
The zombie will randomly move automatically every 500 milliseconds.
If the player and zombie touch, the player is eaten and the game is over.
If the player gets to the door, the player escapes and the game is over.
